Data Acquisition: The stock data is fetched using the yfinance library, where historical market data is downloaded for specified stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL) over a given date range.

Feature Selection: Only the 'Close' price is selected from the raw data for each stock, which serves as the target variable for predictions.

Handling Missing Data: The dataset is cleaned by removing any rows with missing values (dropna()).

Normalization: The dataset is scaled using MinMaxScaler to bring all values within a range of 0 to 1, ensuring the model handles the data more effectively.

Sequence Creation: A sliding window of 60 days is used to create sequences of stock prices, which form the input features (X) and target labels (Y).

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training and 20% for evaluation.
